# Classic Computer Science Problems in Java
This repository contains source code to accompany the book *Classic Computer Science Problems in Java* by David Kopec, [now available in early access form from Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-java?a_aid=oaksnow&a_bid=6430148a). You will find the source organized by chapter. **As you read the book, each code listing contains a file name that corresponds to a file in this repository.** The book is due for publication in late 2020.

## Conventions
The source code was written against version 11 of the Java language and should run on any known newer version at the time of publication. It makes use of no Java libraries beyond the standard library. It was developed in Eclipse and this folder can be opened as an Eclipse workspace. You can then right-click any file with a `main()` method to compile and execute it. It should be possible to import the packages for each chapter into the IDE of your choice as well.

## Other Books and Languages
This is the third book in the Classic Computer Science Problems series by David Kopec and published by Manning. It aims to teach computational problem solving techniques in Java. You may also want to checkout the first book in the series, *Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift*, which covers most of the same problems in a more Swifty way. You can check out the repository for that book on [GitHub as well](https://github.com/davecom/ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInSwift). The second book, is *Classic Computer Science Problems in Python*, which [also has a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/davecom/ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInPython). A reader has also reimplemented the first five chapters of the book [in C++](https://github.com/araya-andres/classic_computer_sci).
