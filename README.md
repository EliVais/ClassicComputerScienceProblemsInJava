## Other Books and Languages
This is the third book in the Classic Computer Science Problems series by David Kopec and published by Manning. It aims to teach computational problem solving techniques in Java. You may also want to checkout the first book in the series, *Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift*, which covers most of the same problems in a more Swifty way. You can check out the repository for that book on [GitHub as well](https://github.com/davecom/ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInSwift). The second book, is *Classic Computer Science Problems in Python*, which [also has a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/davecom/ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInPython). A reader has also reimplemented the first five chapters of the book [in C++](https://github.com/araya-andres/classic_computer_sci).
